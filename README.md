# Outlier Detection in Heart Disease Dataset

## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to demonstrate outlier detection techniques applied to a dataset related to heart disease diagnosis. Outliers, or anomalies, are data points that significantly deviate from the expected behavior of the majority of the dataset. Detecting outliers is crucial in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, as they can indicate potential errors, anomalies, or interesting patterns in the data.

## Introduction
Outlier detection, also known as anomaly detection, involves identifying data points that exhibit behaviors significantly different from the majority of the dataset. In this project, we explore various outlier detection techniques applied to a dataset containing attributes related to heart disease diagnosis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about patients' attributes such as age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, and more. These attributes are used to diagnose the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Outlier Detection Techniques
Univariate Outlier Analysis:
- Interquartile Range (IQR) Method
- Standard Deviation (SD) Method
- Z-Score Method
- Isolation Forest

Multivariate Outlier Analysis:
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- Local Outlier Factor Method (LOF)
- Implementation

The project demonstrates the implementation of each outlier detection technique using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn. Visualizations such as box plots, distribution plots, and scatter plots are used to illustrate the outliers detected by each technique.

## Conclusion
Outlier detection plays a vital role in data preprocessing and analysis. It helps identify potential errors, anomalies, or interesting patterns that may require further investigation. While outlier removal is essential, it's crucial to validate assumptions and thoroughly investigate the dataset to avoid unintended consequences.
